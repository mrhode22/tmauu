## About the Collection

This site is generated using [CollectionBuilder-GH](https://collectionbuilding.github.io/gh/), a project to create a free and simple digital collection using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) from: 

- a CSV of collection metadata
- a folder of JPG images or PDF documents

The template repository features four objects from the University of Idaho Library's [Digital Collections](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital).

This collection is a prototype digital library designed for Union University using resources provided by the Taubman Museum of Art and Virginia Tech.

### Taubman Museum of Art

The Taubman Museum of Art (TMA) is a visual art institution in Roanoke, Virginia. It is accredited by the American Alliance of Museums and boasts over two thousand pieces in its permanent collection. Eleven galleries host fifteen to twenty exhibitions of featured artists each year. The museum itself is housed in a work of art—an avant-garde building designed by architect Randall Stout. TMA offers all of this to its visitors at no cost for general admission.

The permanent collection at TMA includes chiefly American art from the 19th- and early 20th-centuries, modern and contemporary art, photography, design, and decorative arts, and other selections including Southern folk art. There is not enough space to showcase all of these works at once, so they are regularly rotated and highlighted, providing different experiences to frequent visitors. The exhibitions TMA hosts are wide-ranging in genre, style, and media and may focus on a particular artist, region, works from other institutions, or a number of other topics (Learn, 2024).

### Union University

Union University is a Christian liberal arts college located in Jackson, Tennessee. It offers a traditional array of liberal arts disciplines, but—most significant to this project—boasts the top-ranked Christian visual arts program in the nation. Art and Studio Art majors include ceramics, drawing, graphic design, painting, photography, pre-professional art therapy, and sculpture. Union art students (and all students completing the required Arts in Western Civilization course) will benefit from having access to TMA’s rich collections.

### Virginia Tech

TMA collaborated with Virginia Tech (VT) to digitize its many works, beginning with items on permanent display. The digital collection is hosted in VT’s digital library, providing the museum with two advantages: first, that the collection can be accessed online, and second, that the items are preserved digitally. VT worked with TMA to send a photographer to the museum and take digital images for the online collection.
